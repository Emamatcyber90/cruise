Experiments to run for the talk:

A. Single node runs:
        1. showing FUSE overheads (OSU Cluster)
        2. showing ramdisk vs memcpy performance (OSU and Sierra)
        3. write-up memcpy version of test_ramdisk to use in other experiments
        4. stream
        5. Design experiments
                a 1 superblock vs 1-per-process (Sierra)
                b varying number of processes to show NUMA impact (Sierra)
                c varying chunk sizes for a given file

B. Large-scale runs:
        1. scalability, in comparison with tmpfs(Zen / cab)
        2. fast version of memcpy
